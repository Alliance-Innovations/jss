# Solution Structure

## The pros of the default structure


## Helix
[Helix](https://helix.sitecore.net/) is a set of patterns and conventions for back-end Sitecore developers that deal with solution organization and dependency management. Helix is very popular amongst the Sitecore community, so it's recommended that all developers at least learn the concepts (since it will likely come up in a solution structure debate eventually).

From a technical perspective, JSS *component code* is not required to adhere to Helix principles, and front-end developers may define conventions that differ from those of the back-end team.

However, some front-end developers have reported that following Helix principles for component structure and dependency management helped reduce technical debt and the cost of maintenance over time.
