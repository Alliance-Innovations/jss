# Developer Workflows

## Code-First
The manifest API is not a complete replica of everything that can be done with Sitecore items in Sitecore. If your team has hit a roadblock in Code-First workflow, and cannot figure out how to do whatever it is that's supposed to come next, consider whether it's time to switch to Sitecore first. Examples of such scenarios:
	- You need to create branch templates
	- You need to add renderings to standard values
You need the ability to configure Datasource Location on components
